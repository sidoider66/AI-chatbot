This code implements a simple web-based chatbot using Flask (Python backend) and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. Here's a breakdown:

Backend (ai-chat.py)
OpenAI Integration

Sends user prompts to OpenAI's API using the provided API key.

Configures parameters like temperature (response creativity) and max_tokens (response length).

Handles API errors gracefully.

Flask Routes

/chat: Accepts POST requests with user messages, generates responses via OpenAI, and returns JSON.

/: Serves a static index.html file (frontend).

Frontend (index.html)
A minimal UI with a text input, send button, and response display.

Uses JavaScript to:

Send user input to the backend.

Display the AI response dynamically.

Key Features
Lightweight and easy to run locally.

Real-time interaction with ChatGPT.

Basic error handling for API failures.

Critical Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è Security Risks:

The OpenAI API key is hardcoded (exposed publicly).

Debug mode (app.run(debug=True)) is unsafe for production.

üîß Improvement Suggestions:

Store the API key in environment variables.

Add loading indicators and better frontend error messages.

Use HTTPS in production and disable debug mode.

This code serves as a foundational chatbot but requires security enhancements before deployment.
